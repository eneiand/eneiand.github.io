## Force.com and Apex Fundamentals for Developers
### Introduction and Scope
* Nobody likes to be a beginner
* Start with what we know and try to map it to the new domain
* Experts know the subtle language differences, best practices, design patterns, limitations, quirks (don't know you don't know)
* Apex looks familiar, but it is deceptive. Easy to write and test, deployment is another matter.
* Course + documentation on developer.force.com + Advanced Apex Programming book
### A Developer's Perspective of Force.com
* Someone else handles the hardware, backups etc.
* Force.com
  * Multi-tenanted
  * Each application has access to all cloud resources
  * Everyone runs on the same software
  * Pay by user, or % of revenue
  * Limits are built into the APEX language itself to stop one app from monopolising the resources
* Organization
  * A unit of isolation
  * All apps within an organization can share data etc.
  * made up of objects, workflows, reports, email templates, pages, CODE -> metadata
  * you can never edit code on production, you can only deploy it from development org or sandbox org with 75% code coverage by unit tests
