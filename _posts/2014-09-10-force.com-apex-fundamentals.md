## Force.com and Apex Fundamentals for Developers

### Introduction and Scope
* Nobody likes to be a beginner
* Start with what we know and try to map it to the new domain
* Experts know the subtle language differences, best practices, design patterns, limitations, quirks (don't know you don't know)
* Apex looks familiar, but it is deceptive. Easy to write and test, deployment is another matter.
* Course + documentation on developer.force.com + Advanced Apex Programming book

### A Developer's Perspective of Force.com
* Someone else handles the hardware, backups etc.
* Force.com
  * Multi-tenanted
  * Each application has access to all cloud resources
  * Everyone runs on the same software
  * Pay by user, or % of revenue
  * Limits are built into the APEX language itself to stop one app from monopolising the resources
* Organization
  * A unit of isolation
  * All apps within an organization can share data etc.
  * made up of objects, workflows, reports, email templates, pages, CODE -> metadata
  * you can never edit code on production, you can only deploy it from development org or sandbox org with 75% code coverage by unit tests
* Developer org
  * technical library has te developmers guide
  * create developer org by requesting on developer.force.com
  * pick a username that describes what this org will be used for
  * get an API token to use the Apex IDE
  * set password to never expire
  * set a message to describe the org so that when you login you know where you are
* Basic Class Editor
  * Developer apex class in App Setup
  * New test class, use the @istest attribute to define a test
  * call Test.StartTest() and Test.StopTest() to instruct force.com to create an App context
  * Debug log outputs what happened, limits used etc.
  * Code coverage report shows how much and what code is covered
  * Log filters can control the level of logging
  * Basic editor with very little help, it is fast but limited
* Developer Console
  * find code in repository
  * run tests and view code coverage etc.
  * ability to execute anonymous Apex (greate for debugging)
  * good for analysing log files, stack traces
  * limited performance, limited functionality on larger log files
  * evolving quickly
  * a tooling API coming for 3rd parties
