## Force.com and Apex Fundamentals for Developers

### Introduction and Scope
* Nobody likes to be a beginner
* Start with what we know and try to map it to the new domain
* Experts know the subtle language differences, best practices, design patterns, limitations, quirks (don't know you don't know)
* Apex looks familiar, but it is deceptive. Easy to write and test, deployment is another matter.
* Course + documentation on developer.force.com + Advanced Apex Programming book

### A Developer's Perspective of Force.com
* Someone else handles the hardware, backups etc.
* Force.com
  * Multi-tenanted
  * Each application has access to all cloud resources
  * Everyone runs on the same software
  * Pay by user, or % of revenue
  * Limits are built into the APEX language itself to stop one app from monopolising the resources
* Organization
  * A unit of isolation
  * All apps within an organization can share data etc.
  * made up of objects, workflows, reports, email templates, pages, CODE -> metadata
  * you can never edit code on production, you can only deploy it from development org or sandbox org with 75% code coverage by unit tests
* Developer org
  * technical library has te developmers guide
  * create developer org by requesting on developer.force.com
  * pick a username that describes what this org will be used for
  * get an API token to use the Apex IDE
  * set password to never expire
  * set a message to describe the org so that when you login you know where you are
* Basic Class Editor
  * Developer apex class in App Setup
  * New test class, use the @istest attribute to define a test
  * call Test.StartTest() and Test.StopTest() to instruct force.com to create an App context
  * Debug log outputs what happened, limits used etc.
  * Code coverage report shows how much and what code is covered
  * Log filters can control the level of logging
  * Basic editor with very little help, it is fast but limited
* Developer Console
  * find code in repository
  * run tests and view code coverage etc.
  * ability to execute anonymous Apex (greate for debugging)
  * good for analysing log files, stack traces
  * limited performance, limited functionality on larger log files
  * evolving quickly
  * a tooling API coming for 3rd parties
* Force.com IDE
  * Seperate download or plugin on top of Eclipse
  * downloads current metadata from your org
  * run tests, sync metadata to and from the server
  * sometimes slow because of web comms, force.com IDE has been neglected
  * primary tool for serious development
* Where Code Lives
  * Code is just another part of your organisation metadata
  * Force.com IDE takes a copy of the metadata locally
  * Can lead to sync issues because dev console and UI do not copy
* Development Strategy 
  * Org or package?
  * Sandbox is best for single sepcific org
  * at any time the sandbox can be refreshed and killed (Admin)
  * Force.com IDE (copy of code), or schedule frequent backups
  * for package development use developer org
  * developer org is safe from refreshes
  * use IDE for package development, use dev console for debug,test and prototype
  * Team Development and Sync
    * reversion to earlier changes is not always possible
    * no accepted best practices at team development, lots of approaches
    * not friendly file structure for source control
 * Debugging
   * still primitive
   * breakpoint not possible because of multi-tenancy
   * system debug statements is where you spend most time
   * build your own instrumentation inside your application
 * Other Tools
   * force.com migration tool
   * data loader
   * security source scanner
   * visual force dev environment
   * switch on dev mode in your profile and you can create pages, wiki style + editor
 * Anyone who can modify organization metadata is a developer, since metadata is everything
 * Programming languages and practices are different depending on the underlying platform, force.com also has its own environment to learn

### Apex Programming Fundamentals
* SOQL (similar to LINQ)
* usual control structures, no select case statement
* ID datatype, Integer, usuals, Date and DateTime
* Everything is an object
* List, Set and Map
* Execution Context
  * sets governor limits eg. 1m loc per execution context
  * defines scope and lifetime of static variables
  * single thread, different execution contexts may run in different threads
  * an external even occurs that invokes your code
    * db trigger
    * scheduled apex
    * web service
    * inbound email
  * order of trigger execution is arbitrary
  * you can't prevent someone else ffrom creating a workflow that can significantly imapce the execution of your code
  * you know when an execution context starts but not when it ends
* Static Variables
  * very important to Apex applications
  * global to all instances of a class within a single execution context
  * single threaded so no sync required
