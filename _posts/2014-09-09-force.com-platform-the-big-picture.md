* Metadata
  * persisted information that desceribes the application's functionaility and presentation
  * drives the dynamic engine
  * describes behaviour, appearance, schema, logic, security, code
  * mostly XML documents
  * point and click through declarative setup menu moslty
  * metadata api platform service level CRUD data operations
  * lots of metadata we don't see or manage
  * Code is metadata
  * Code is metadata aware
  * Code lives in the database
    * Apex classses and triggers, Visualforce pages etc
    * See them in the schema browser
  * Changes to declarative metadata can impact code, even make unit tests fail
  
* Exploring Force.com SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)
  * Force.com is PaaS, Salesforce is SaaS
  * Force.com is on demand application development
  * Infrastructure -> Database -> Application Logic -> Controller and APIs -> View
  * Features and services cross architectural layers
  * Service oriented architecture
    * Collection of services that communciate over a network
    * SOAP and REST APIs expose the service layers
  * Force.com security
    * Very robust and configurable
    * Single Sign On
    * OAuth
    * User profile based authorization
      * row access
      * field access etc
      * mobile app aware
  * Notifications
  * Workflow
  * Chatter
  
  * SOAP API
    * first api
    * CRUD operations on data
    * some admin capabilities
    * data is processed in batches <=200records
    * not efficient for high volumes
  * REST API
    * similar to SOAP API
    * good for mobile and web, supports JSON and XML
  * BULK (REST) API
    * good for large data sets, optimised for jobs over 10k records
    * async background
  * Metadata (SOAP) API
    * CRUD operations on metadata
    * used in developer tools
  * Streaming API
    * real time event notifications
    * push and subscribe model
  * Apex SOAP and REST APIs
    * Apex SOAP web methds
    * Apex REST resources
    * HTTP Verbs on classes (DELETE, GET, PATCH)
  * Chatter
    * Social data and processing
  * AJAX toolkit
    * Not a  web service
    * Javascript API for calling APIs from web etc.
  * API Considerations
    * context of a specified user (authenticated user context)
    * limited number of API hits permitted based on user
    * APIs are versioned and end points include numbers
    * Database.com and Heroku add to the open platform
    
* Ramping on Force.com
  * 90:10 = Clicks:Code
  * important to understand the declarative nature of the platform
    * limits
  * The Database
    * objects and fields
    * SOQL like SQL
    * SOSL
    * seemingly invisible indexing
  * The Progrmming Languages
    * APEX
      * OO
      * Like Java
      * No visible ORM
      * Code compiled and stored in metadata
      * Governor limits on shared multi-tenant resources
    * Visualforce
      * Tag based web app language
  * The Security Model
    * user permissions and profile mechanism
    * system access
    * feature access
    * navigation access
    * object and field access
  * The Development Environments
    * code resides as meta data in a dtabase
    * eclipse based 'force.com IDE'
    * code runs only on the Force.com cloud
    * some browser based tools
    * not a mature dev environment
  * YOU CAN'T AVOID THE DECLARATIVE 
  * Start with the basics of the declarative framework
  * learn about APEX and Visualforce later
  * Learning Pathways
    * developer.force.com -> bottomless pit of information
    * free developer licence
    * online community
    * developer relations at Salesforce
    * DreamForce -> YouTube, pay attention to the age of the content
    * Build something!
