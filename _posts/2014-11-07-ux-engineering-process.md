#### Building Products
* UX Process
  *
* Bill Scott and PayPal
  * moving from "how do we get the product out the door" to "how do we delight customers"
* Break Down the Walls
  * product, design, engineering have walls between them
  * no focus on continuously improving experience
* Netflix: Rapid Experimentation
  * as few people as possible in each teams
  * less talent you have the more process you need
  * 90% or more of the UI code was thrown away every year
* Lessons Learned
  * design for volatility & throwawayability
    * build test and learn
    * how buildings learn
    * recognize that different layers change at different velocities
    * all software are predictions, all predictions are wrong
  * start with the experience
    * learning if it is worth the investment
  * build in rapid experimentation
* Q&A
  * for "ideation" use less technology, it can slow you down
  * optimizely

#### Lean UX
* Lean Manufacturing
  * drawing upon the knowledge of individuals
  * stories aren't complete until learnings happen
  * smaller batch sizes
* Lean UX
  * MVP, build/test/learn, when to pivot, kanban, small batches
* Three Key Principles for Lean UX
  * shared understanding -> more understanding the less documentation you need
  * deep collaboration -> trust, belief that ideas come from many different voices
  * continuous customer feedback -> gets rid of politics, good happens just by talking to customers even when done badly
* A Healthy Product Lifecycle
  * discover customer insights, define customer problems, define solution concepts, deliver and test solutions, repeat
  *
* Key Lessons from a Lean UX Team
  * lean is not agile, avoid adopting all the agile ceremonies
  * co-locate if at all possible
  * create a team working agreement. who is the decision maker, define your cadence, define how you will work together, define your hypotheses
  * sprint faster than agile
  * sketch to code, brings about a close collaboration between engineering and design
  * make the spec real, prototype becomes the spec
  * watch out for docs that are really process
* Example: Spotify
  *
* Q&A
