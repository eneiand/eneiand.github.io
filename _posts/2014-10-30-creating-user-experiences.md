#### The need for new thinking by developers
* The need for new thinking by developers
  * "as our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew"
  * "For the history of software, it's been good enough to make things possible. Now success also depends on making things easy."
  * design is more than just a pretty face
* Stuck in a rut
  * no longer the tech that holds us back
  * for some systems it is not worth it
  * payoff can be huge
    * higher productivity
    * lower training
    * few errors
    * more satisfied users
  * book: "out of our minds" by Ken Robinson
* Evolution as a useful mental model
  * ecosystem changing requires changes to survive
  * designing user interfaces hasn't been a requirement in the .NET ecosystem
* Example to learn from: the music industry
  * ipod
  * music industry got too comfortable and things changed
* StaffLynx as an example
  * business apps have come a long way from terminal based to web based
* Preparing for the new ecosystem
  * principles are learnable and fundmental
  * pattern matching
* A test of awareness and observation
  * moonwalking bear!
  * _inattentional blindness_
    * you won't see what you're not looking for
    * your area of focus is tiny, size of a quarter at arms length
    * book: _Universal Principles of Design_ (Lidwell, Holden, Butler)

#### Design principles for choosing options
Looking at some objects in the real world to learn about design and applying those things to our designs. We need to understand why the objects are good or bad. Lets look at things with the "designers eye"

* What's wrong with this elevator?
  * observations: buttons and description seperate, increase left to right
  * didn't notice there is no 13th floor
  * alignment is a little bit off
  * worn off paint shows people confuse the buttons with the description
  * buttons are round in real life -> archetypes
    * certain objects and actions have a universal or near-universal form or theme
* The Gestalt principle of proximity
  * things that are grouped spatially are associated together
  * not grouping makes it difficult to figure out without greater context
  * button should be close to placard, placard and buttons should be different shapes
* Some important design principles for choosing options
  * Fitt's law.
    * the amount of time required to locate and use an option is smaller if the option is bigger
  * on the elevator the most often visited places are larger and more prominent
  * Pareto Principle (80/20) -> likely that 4 or 5 of the buttons are used for 80% of user actions
  * Hick's law -> the time required to locate and use an option increases as the number of options increases.
* Hick's Law and its consequences
   * every time you add an option, it decreases the value of the other options
   * can violate if you expect users to be highly trained and use the app a lot
   * long lists and trees are commonplace, devs don't think about the usability
   * most often they just add it to an existing list
* Alternatives to ridiculously long lists of options
  * remove all but the 20% most used features
  * or shrink the less common ones
  * standard area and an advanced area
  * make the most prominent be bigger
  * design principles don't tell you exactly what to do, just guides.
* Users outnumber developers, plus summary and next steps
  * users expect more from their software
  * real world objects are good examples of good and bad design

#### Visual Scanning and Processing
human visual system is tuned to certain shapes etc.
  * tuned to detect edges
  * start to make sense in 1/4 second
    * shapes and groups
  * experience used to interpret the output of stage 2
  * we're mostly concerned with the second stage
* The Gestalt principles of proximity and similarity
  * do you see rows or columns? depends on spacing and proximity
  * easy to mix up rows or columns of buttons
  * objects that are similar are considered to be related and that overrides proximity
    * color, shape or size (size does not work as well)
* More grouping gestalt principles
  * similarity to show relations
  * grouping to show relations
  * violating similarity can cause something to stand out (highlight)
  * Common fate:
    * involves movement
    * items that move together are assumed to be connected
  * continuity and closure:
    * visual system will fill in gaps automatically
    * spaces are filled in
  * Gestalt closure, continuity, and figure/ground
    * fading text implies more text
    * a path that dissapears
    *
