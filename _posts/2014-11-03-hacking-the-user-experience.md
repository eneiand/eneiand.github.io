#### Defining User Experience
* Getting Started
  * UX != UI, UI just the visible tip
  * UI + Design & Technology + Science & Research
* On the Surface
  * UX is how a person feels about interacting with a product
  * Customer Experience is how a person feeld about interacting with a brand
  * As devs "How a person feels about interacting with my application"
* Our Desired Result
  * Happy -> share your app, increased sales,
  * Satisfied -> increased loyalty, fewer support requests, new ideas not complaints
  * Productive -> All 3 = MVP (Most Valuable Proponents)
* Hacking Feelings?
  * Root API of the brain, common to all
* The Deeper Meaning
  * UX is the measure of friction between a user and their goal
    * low is good
  * types of friction:
    * cognitive -> core api, foundation
    * emotional -> very personal
    * physical -> keyboard etc.
  * cognitive friction:
    * needless brain activity
    * elements:
      * visual noise
      * showing too many fields
      * a lot of scrolling through things we didn't need

#### Preparing to be UX Hackers

* Getting Started
  * need to look at ourselves
    * problem solvers
    * prone to technical tunnel-vision
  * Change behaviors
    * repetition
* Becoming User-Centered
  * UX professionals research:
    * who the user is
    * what the user needs
  * "putting the user at the center of every decision we make"
  * "we are not the user" our assumptions can be wildly different to reality
    * only good way is to talk to the user
    * just knowing that we are not the user is an important thing to remember
  * "Does the decision I'm making benefit the user or....me?"
* 7 Common Pitfalls
  * throwing data on the screen -> easier for us, not best for the user
  * exposing tech to the user -> users don't understand tech terms, jargon vs. using normal language
  * forcing the user to think like a DBA -> making users work like the database does vs. giving them something intuitive
  * Messy UI -> laziness or excuses like "I'm not good at UI"
  * Being inconsistent -> not paying attention to detail, placement of buttons, labels, alignment
  * coding for the "expert user" -> avoid the hard work of making something easy to use
  * coding for edge cases -> trying to solve every problem, non-existent problems etc. the user might want to do x or y or z
* Identifying and Confronting Cognitive Bias
  * there are a lot of them, RSOAP - A Visual Study Guide to Cognitive Biases (104+!)
  * they shape our thinking and decisions
  * 7 deadly developer biases ( keeping an open mind )
    * tendency to not compensate for one's own cognitive biases
    * deformation professionelle, the tendency to look at things according to the conventions of one's own profession, forgetting any broader point of view
    * semmelweis reflex -> tendency to reject new evidence that contradicts an established paradigm
    * bandwagon effect -> tendency to do or believe things because many other people do or believe the same
    * confirmation bias -> tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions
    * status quo bias -> tendency for people to like things to stay relatively the same, can interfere with exploring and accepting new ideas
    * reactance -> the urge to do the opposite of what someone wants you to do out of a need to resist a perceived attempt to constrain your freedom of choice

#### UX Myth Busters

* Getting Started
  * born out of incorrect or outdated information
  * experienced or enterprise devs more likely to believe these myths
* 10 UX Myths
  * counting clicks -> not the number of clicks, it is the cognitive friction that matters
  * whitespace, we need to show as much data as possible, no waste -> outdated, whitespace helps reduce cognitive and emotional friciton
  * scrolling is evil -> actually vertical scrolling is fine, try to reduce horizontal scrolling
  * Small details don't matter -> small details can dramatically improve UX, perception of quality is primal and matters
  * more choices -> choices can turn a straight path into a series of forks and crossroads, give them one good way to do something
  * users make good choices -> some users just guess, most decision making is subconscious
  * users know what they want -> want != need, they'll often request more than they can handle, requests made in group settings are unreliable
  * usability > beauty -> users will judge the quality and credibility of an app by its appearance and maybe abandon them
  * let's do it like -> make sure that the company you are copying is appropriate for your users
  * UX is a project step -> it is an iterative process, the earlier you start, the better


#### Hacking the User's Vision

* Getting Started
  * how the brain "sees"
* Shapes Hack
  * make UIs easier to understand by using shapes
  * first thing the brain does is recognise shapes
  * then match it to patterns in their brain
  * central vision (details) -> small as a coin
  * peripheral requires less processing, prefer letting the user understand without having to use ventral vision
* Whitespace Hack
  * let brains rest by using whitespace
  * reduce requirement on central vision
* Grouping Hack
  * group elements effectively
  * user's brain loves groups
  * make the groups easy to distinguish, not too close together
  * repeating groups without enough seperation are troublesome
* Alignment Hack
  * consider reading direction
  * a few pixels does matter, the brain has to work more
  * consider vertical alignment too
  * left alignment can be problematic when labels get long
  * right or top aligned overcome the length problem
  * look for sub groups, seperate and consistently align within those groups
  * Align content within elements on center, center
* Attention Hack
  * allow the user to focus more effectively by attracting attention
  * change blindness, did anything happen?
  * attention on the button, not on the data
  * movement is easily detected in peripheral vision
  * eliminate movement when focus is required
* Color Hack
  * avoid bad color combinations
  * avoid using blue or green on red, or red or green on blue (hard on the eyes)
  * contrast is critical
  * white or black text? 24ways.org/2010/calculating-color-contrast
  * color blindness (5-8% of males, <1% of females)
  * don't use color alone to convey information, use an icon too

#### Hacking the User's Mind

* Getting Started
  * more difficult
* Leading Hack
  * make user brain work less by leading them toward their goal
  * labeled and numbered groups, option to turn off
  * semi-transparent "onboard" overlay to show how to use it
  * wizard, break a goal into steps, header with numbered steps
  * cognitive friction high when path is unclear
* Progressive Hack
  * only show the user what they need, when they need it
  * stops the user from getting overwhelmed
  * focused, bitesize chunks
  * list of options
  * most frequent immediately available, the rest hidden
* Status Hack
  * keep the user calm by keeping them informed
  * using the egg timer doesn't help
  * show what's remaining, counting down is better when processing
  * most things are possible to get a status, just harder for dev
  * keep things moving
* Recognition Hack
  * Make it easy for our user's brain to recognize things vs. using their memory.
  * value information over data
  * help with things you can remind the user of
  * avoid abstract codes
  * recall is a high friction activity

#### Testing our UX Hacks
* Finding Users to Test
  * internal users
  * existing customers
  * social media
  * 5-10 people
* Simple In-Person Tests
  * visit users at their disk
  * show them before and after
  * avoid questions with yes or no answers, why x? can you tell me?
  * avoid opinions, ask "how did you decide where to go next?"
  * avoid leading questions
  * avoid priming questions ( including words that relate to the UI next step), instead use "How would you proceed?"
  * usabilityhub.com
* Simple Online Tests

#### The Path Forward
  * 100 things every designer needs to know about people
  * Designing with the Mind in Mind
  * Don't make me think
