#### Defining User Experience
* Getting Started
  * UX != UI, UI just the visible tip
  * UI + Design & Technology + Science & Research
* On the Surface
  * UX is how a person feels about interacting with a product
  * Customer Experience is how a person feeld about interacting with a brand
  * As devs "How a person feels about interacting with my application"
* Our Desired Result
  * Happy -> share your app, increased sales,
  * Satisfied -> increased loyalty, fewer support requests, new ideas not complaints
  * Productive -> All 3 = MVP (Most Valuable Proponents)
* Hacking Feelings?
  * Root API of the brain, common to all
* The Deeper Meaning
  * UX is the measure of friction between a user and their goal
  * low is good
  * types of friction:
    * cognitive, core api, foundation
    * emotional, very personal
    * physical, keyboard etc.
  * cognitive friction:
    * needless brain activity
    * elements:
      * visual noise
      * showing too many fields
      * a lot of scrolling through things we didn't need
