### Using the Force.com Database
Building the data model for our solution

* Creating data objects
  * data entities are called sObjects
    * similar to tables in a database
    * created though the full featured management portal
    * name, description
      * permissions
      * field history tracking
      * report visibility
  * sObjects can be
    * standard (restricted, foundation)
    * custom
  * can re-use standard objects, eg renaming contacts to donors
  * 
* Adding fields
  * sObject fields are like columns in a databae table
    * data type influences storage, UI, API and reporting
    * custom fields have a "__c" appended to the end of them
  * sObjects support a wide range of field types
    * text, varying sizes, encrypted
    * checkbox
    * picklist / dependent picklist (relationships between country & state for example)
    * date
    * number / currency / percent
    * email / phone/ url
    * auto number (unique ids)
  * can add and customize fields on custom or standard objects
* Defining relationships
 * lookup, loosely coupled 1:N
 * master-detail, tightly coupled 1:N, child record is intrinsically tied to the parent, enables use of rollups
 * self
 * many to many
  * junction objects
 * create relationships in the point, click interface "custom fields and relationships". 
  * choose how each object is related
  * UI will show relations, lookups for example when creating the child.
  * similar to foreign keys
* leveraging formula fields
  * calculated at runtime
  * conditional statements, functions (eg. TODAY()), literal values
  * global variables such as $User.LastName
  * access fields
  * formula values appear when creating the new object, or in calculated fields when saved
* data structure visualization
  * schema builder
  * graphically build up the model
  * no deletion of:
    * objects
    * fields
    * relationships
  
* querying database objects SOQL
  * salesforce object query language
    * SELECT fieldname FROM objectname WHERE
    * ORDER BY
    * JOINS
    * AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX and SUM
    * GROUP BY
    * LIMIT
  * Workbench tool for testing queries
    * https://workbench.developerforce.com/login.php 
* searching database objects SOSL
  * full text search across objects
