#### OWIN and Katana
* Katana
  * ASP.NET has been built on top of IIS so far
  * Not everyone needs all these features, especially as more processing moves to the client
  * Pressure to make it more lightweight
  * Highly modular
* OWIN
  * Katana is MS implementation of OWIN (Open Web Interface for .NET)
  * Goal is to decouple web servers and web frameworks
* WebServer Console
  * reference Owin, Owin.Host.HttpListener, Owin.Hosting
  * define a Startup class 
  * define Configuration, takes an IAppBuilder, app.Run() given funcs that get called with a request
  * import pieces, call app.something to enable things
* The AppFunc
  * how components process and interact with the server
  * Func<IDictionary<string, object>, Task>
  * takes environment, returns a Task (for async ness)
  * all about components in a pipeline
  * constructor takes an AppFunc (the next func/component in the pipeline)
  * when you say app.Use<Component> it gets into the pipeline
  * looks for an Invoke function to pass the environment
* Middleware
  * OWIN Components = middleware
  * app.Run is a shortcut to run and automatically call the next func
  * await next(); to explicitly call the next func (lambda must be async)
  * before the call to await is the request, after the await will be the response
* Adding an API
  * Host -> Server -> Katana -> Application
  * Nancy and WebAPI -> no dependency on System.Web or ASP.NET
  * app.UseWebApi -> pass a configuration with routes etc.
  * web api doesn't call any further components
* Moving to IIS
  * create a DLL instead without the startup part
  * call iisexpress.exe with the path to the dir above bin
* OWIN and MVC5
  * Startup uses Katana and an IAppBuilder setting up Authentication
  * katana project codeplex
