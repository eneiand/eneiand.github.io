### Programming Style & Your Brain

* The Way We Think
  * Some styles are profoundly better than others
  * Gut and Head are two systems we use (Thinking Fast and Slow)
    *  head takes a long time and takes a lot of effort
    *  gut solves simple, close problems quickly
    *  gut provides the working assumptions to the head
    *  invalid inputs all the time
    *  advertising targets and sells to the gut
* The Programming Thought Process
  * computer programs are the most complicated things that people make
  * hard to do with our brains as in "The Way We Think"
  * programming language still our best tool
  * the need for perfection is one of the problems, all possible inputs
  * we release software early to find imperfection
  * programming uses head and gut, tradeoffs required
* JavaScript: Good Parts and Bad Parts
  * some of the best good parts and worst bad parts 
  * JSLint checks you are using sane subset of the language
  * always put curly braces on right (auto semi-colon insertion error otherwise)
  * prefer forms that are error resistant
  * switch statement, similar and inspired by goto statement (fallthrough hazard)
    * error vs. elegance
    * if I never intentionally fallthrough, I can find the places where I accidentally fallthrough
  * we spend most of our time making mistakes and fixing them
* Understanding Good Programming
  * "That hardly ever happens" === "It happens"
  * trying to be perfect? you can't allow it to ever happen
  * a good style can help produce better programs, reduce your error rate
  * style is not about personal preference and self-expresion
  * programs must communicate clearly to people, not just get past the compiler
  * never rely on  automatic semicolon insertion
  * with statement is unpredictable, we are trying to avoid confusion
* Avoiding Confusing Code (A)
  * confusion must be avoided
  * 
* Avoiding Confusing Code (B)
* Using JSLint
