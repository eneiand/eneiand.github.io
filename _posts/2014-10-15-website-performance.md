#### Make Performance a Priority
* Why Web Performance?
  * don't focus entirely on optimisation, it is part of the overall process
  * be aware of the user, they may not have the hardware you have
  * performance golden rule:
    * "80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the frontent. Start there." - Steve Souders
* Performance and User Experience
  * performance is important to an end user
  * webpagetest.org
  * the order in which things load can greatly enhance the perception of the site
  * "visual completeness"
  * document ready is the point that a user can meaningfully interact with the page
  * choices and tradeoffs impact web performance
  * whichloadsfaster.com
* How We Get Web Performance
  * $ even a tenth of a second can  cost companies money (Google, Amazon)
  * Quality, high performance is quality
  * web, measurement and perception
    * consider the user, ads over content ?
  * efficiency, speed and memory
  * performance, benchmark and optimize
    * need to be able to quantify, get actual numbers
    * user studies
* Focus on the Critical Path
  * "premature optimizatoin is the root of all evil" -- Donald Knuth
  * decide what is critical, the 3%
  * Optimization, noncritical vs critical
  * "noncritical path optimization is the root of all evil"
  * 100ms no difference, 1000ms there was a delay but ok
  * composed operations -> "Death by a thousand papercuts"
  * inefficiency is systemic
* The Total Cost of Ownership
  * The myth of the refactor, broken refactor promise
  * long term cost of ownership of non-performant code is greater
  * we need performant by default
  * most of "rfont-end" happens ni the middle ned
