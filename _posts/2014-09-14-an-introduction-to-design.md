# An Introduction to Design

  * Design is a learnable skill

## Typography

  * better communicate through text
  * Considerations
    * typeface choice
    * size of the type
    * leading (space between lines)
    * tracking (space between letters)
    * measure (length of lines)
    * hierarchy
    * context
    * aesthetics
  * Typeface -> something that is created by a type designer (Times New Roman). The way it looks
  * Font -> implementation, files etc.
  * Typeface Families
    * a number of typefaces that are stylistically related
    * Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic are the variations within the same family
  * Type
    * referring to printed characters
    * baseline is an imaginary line on top of which the characters sit
    * x-height is height from baseline to top of lowercase letters (x)
    * kerning is space between two letters, attempt to make the letters look aesthetically even with different spacing between them
    * ascenders are the vertical stems of letters raised in an upward direction
    * descenvers are the downware stems below the baseline
    * leading is space between baselines (line spacing)
    * tracking is the space between all the letters in the text (kerning is space between pairs)
    * serifs are small extra shapes at the end of some line strokes. hairline (thin), slab (thick, square), wedge (triangular). sans serif means no serif
  * Categories of Typeface
    * humanist. sloping e
    * old style. wedge serifs, horizontal e
    * transitional
    * modern
    * slab serif
    * sans serif
  * The difference between legibility and readability
    * legibility (perception)
      * zoomed in view
      * how easy is it to recognise individual letters
      * differentiation between letters
      * inherent in fonts
    * readability (understanding)
      * macro level
      * words, phrases, paragaphs
      * overall ease of comprehension
      * reading comfort
      * combination of font & our layout, so we can influence it.
    * Readabiltiy in Context
      * the physical, psychological and emotional context
      * novel vs. magazine heading vs. road signs
    * Measure
      * length of a line of text
      * above 80 chars can disrupt natural reading rythym
      * overly long can cause reading fatigue
      * too short can become disjointed
      * 65 is a basic rule of thumb (40 -65- 80)
    * Leading
      * spacing between lines of text
      * too little can make it less readable. Cramped, claustraphobic
      * a guideline is to set leading to 120% of text size 
    * Scale
      * limited set of sizes is often better than arbitrary
      * categorise types of text (heading, subheading, main body, caption etc)
      * choose sizes appropriately (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) etc.
      * use scale consistently
    * Vertical Rhythm
      * setting size and leading to space out vertically
      * a set of baselines layout the grid, giving order and balance
    * Kerning
      * sometimes need to do manual to make clear
      * most often needed when working with large letters
      * as type size increases so do the space between letters


## Color - Models and Meanings

* The Science of Light and Color
  * electromagnetic spectrum, long to short wavelength radiation, Visible light contains what we can see
  * human sight is eye and brain working together, electromagnetic radiation enters the eye
  * brain receives information and perceives the colors
  * color is our perception of electromagnetic radiation
  * subtractive color, start with white light then subtract colors from it to give final color we see
  * additive color, starts with black and adds different wavelengths of light to it to create colors
* Color models: RGB and CMYK
  * ways of representing colors based on values
  * RGB we assign values to Red, Green and Blue. (255 0 0 -> brightest red) (255 255 0 -> yellow)
  * Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black 
* Color and Meaning: Red
  * highly sensual, strawberries, red wine, lipstick
  * danger, blood, aggressive, tempting
  * attracts attention
  * use of red needs care and attention, overuse can be demanding on viewer
  * passionate, hot, strong, dangerous
* Color and Meaning: Green
  * color of nature
  * vegetables, hills
  * relaxing and calming
  * harmonious, agreeable
* Color and Meaning: Blue
  * quiet coolness
  * stillness, tranquility
  * introspection, sometimes sadness
  * constancy, loyalty and dependability -> often used for logos
  * spacious peaceful, cool, open, faithful
* Color and Meaning: Orange
  * enthusiasm and energy
  * fiery sunset
  * hot color, food
  * sharp mental activity
  * dynamic, stimulating, juicy, happy, playful
* Color and Meaning: Purple
  * healing, amethyst
  * rare in nature
  * spiritual, cerebral, mysterious, meditative
* Color and Meaning: Yellow
  * the color of light
  * sunflowers
  * friendly and enlightening
  * energetic, extroverted, youthful
* Coloe and Meaning: Brown
  * wholesome and rustic
  * working the land, nature
  * arouse appetite.
  * coffee, chocolate
  * homely, solid, balanced
* Color and Meaning: Black and White
  * night and day
  * final simple truth
  * pure, simple, innocent
  * strong, sober, heavy, sophisticated
* Cultural Color Differences
  * red means death in Mexico, good luck in China, nature in Netherlands
* Demo: Color Schemes
  * monochromatic scheme uses 5 shades of the same color. balanced
  * analogous scheme uses colours that are close together
  * complementary provides maximum contrast (opposites on the color wheel)
  * Triadic gives 3 equally spaced colors, not maximum but contrasting
* Taking Inspiration from the Real World
  * photos of things around us that we like can give us color schemes

## The Fundamental Gestalt Principles = Understanding Perception
Understanding human perception. Take advantage of the common principles that guide how we perceive the world around us.

* The Principle of Proximity
  * Things that are closer to each other seem related
  * People sitting together at a table
  * grouping things together make them seem related somehow
  * even if they are not the same we still see them as related
  * grouping on keyboards, calculator keys etc.
* The Principle of Similarity
  * Things that have similarities seem related
  * squares and triangles, despite size
  * triangles, size
  * grouping by colour
* The Principle of Figure-Ground
  * Things stand out from the background
  * we focus on the figures, background is ignored
  * face vs. vase picture
  * we don't pay attention to "ground" eg. white page vs "figure" -> letters
* The Principle of Symmetry
  * Two symmetrical halves appear as one
  * We try to perceive things as shapes around a central point
  * [] [] [], 3 pairs not 6 brackets
* The Prcinciple of Closure
  * Filling in the blanks
  * process of drawing conclusions from the often incomplete information around us
* The Principle of Common Fate
  * Things that are moving in the same direction seem related
  * things moving in different directions are perceived as different groups
* The Principle of Uniform Connectedness
  * visually connected things seem related
  * connect things with lines to form groups
  * draw a box around grouped things
* The Principle of Good Continuation
  * things on a line or curve seem related
  * paragraph of text 
  * all words on a line seem to be a group
  * our eye follows lines/curves etc.
* The Interplay of Principles
  * how the principles work together creates the overall feel
  * principles in competition can overpower each other
* Spot the Principle
  *
