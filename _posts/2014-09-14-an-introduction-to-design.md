# An Introduction to Design

  * Design is a learnable skill

## Typography

  * better communicate through text
  * Considerations
    * typeface choice
    * size of the type
    * leading (space between lines)
    * tracking (space between letters)
    * measure (length of lines)
    * hierarchy
    * context
    * aesthetics
  * Typeface -> something that is created by a type designer (Times New Roman). The way it looks
  * Font -> implementation, files etc.
  * Typeface Families
    * a number of typefaces that are stylistically related
    * Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic are the variations within the same family
  * Type
    * referring to printed characters
    * baseline is an imaginary line on top of which the characters sit
    * x-height is height from baseline to top of lowercase letters (x)
    * kerning is space between two letters, attempt to make the letters look aesthetically even with different spacing between them
    * ascenders are the vertical stems of letters raised in an upward direction
    * descenvers are the downware stems below the baseline
    * leading is space between baselines (line spacing)
    * tracking is the space between all the letters in the text (kerning is space between pairs)
    * serifs are small extra shapes at the end of some line strokes. hairline (thin), slab (thick, square), wedge (triangular). sans serif means no serif
  * Categories of Typeface
    * humanist. sloping e
    * old style. wedge serifs, horizontal e
    * transitional
    * modern
    * slab serif
    * sans serif
  * The difference between legibility and readability
    * legibility (perception)
      * zoomed in view
      * how easy is it to recognise individual letters
      * differentiation between letters
      * inherent in fonts
    * readability (understanding)
      * macro level
      * words, phrases, paragaphs
      * overall ease of comprehension
      * reading comfort
      * combination of font & our layout, so we can influence it.
    * Readabiltiy in Context
      * the physical, psychological and emotional context
      * novel vs. magazine heading vs. road signs
    * Measure
      * length of a line of text
      * above 80 chars can disrupt natural reading rythym
      * overly long can cause reading fatigue
      * too short can become disjointed
      * 65 is a basic rule of thumb (40 -65- 80)
    * Leading
      * spacing between lines of text
      * too little can make it less readable. Cramped, claustraphobic
      * a guideline is to set leading to 120% of text size 
    * Scale
      * limited set of sizes is often better than arbitrary
      * categorise types of text (heading, subheading, main body, caption etc)
      * choose sizes appropriately (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) etc.
      * use scale consistently
    * Vertical Rhythm
      * setting size and leading to space out vertically
      * a set of baselines layout the grid, giving order and balance
    * Kerning
      * sometimes need to do manual to make clear
      * most often needed when working with large letters
      * as type size increases so do the space between letters
