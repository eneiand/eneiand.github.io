#### Getting Started
* Getting Bootstrap
  * dist folder contains everything you need 
* Adding Bootstrap to Page
  * css/bootstrap.min.css
  * placed before our stylesheet so we can override it
  * js/bootstrap.min.js on the bottom
  * "container" class on parent div
* What is the Grid System?
  * built on a grid of 12 units 
  * 2 columns = 2 elements taking up 6 units of the grid each
  * classes .col-xx-6, xx = size of screen (md = medium)
  * .col-xx-offset to move in units
* Using the Grid System
* Multiple Grid Types
  * seperate grids for each screen size
  * lg >=1200px, md >= 992, sm >=768px, xs < 768px
  * .col-md-6 .col-xs-12 -> on medium take us 6 units, on xs take up the whole thing
* Using Multiple Grids
  *  
* Offsets and Rows
  * wrap elements in a row  inside a container
  * use offset to center
* Images and Responsive Helpers
  *  pull-left or pull-right classes for text flowing
  *  img-thumbnail will style it responsively
  *  hidden-xs means this element is hidden on xs screen
  *  visible-xs only visible in xs
